# 🚀 Tic-Tac-Toe: The Ultimate Waste of Your Time

Congratulations! You've stumbled upon yet another **Tic-Tac-Toe** implementation—because apparently, the world didn’t already have **10 million** versions of it. But hey, if writing a basic AI for a game that a 5-year-old can master in 30 minutes is your definition of "fun," then who am I to judge?

## 🤡 Features (If You Can Call Them That)

- **🔮 Minimax Algorithm:** A fancy way of saying "it brute-forces every possible move like a desperate job seeker sending out résumés." It’s not smart—it just doesn’t have anything better to do.

- **🖥️ Stunning Graphics:** If you enjoy staring at a **3x3 grid** of text like it’s the Mona Lisa, then buddy, you’re in for a treat.

- **🎮 Smooth Gameplay:** As long as you can handle the **excitement of typing numbers** and waiting for a response from a Python script. Who needs AAA graphics when you have… a console window?

## 🛠️ Installation

Because apparently, downloading yet another Tic-Tac-Toe script is how you spend your free time.

1. **Clone the repository** (because you want this masterpiece on your machine):

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/general_prime/tictactoe.git
   cd tictactoe
   ```

2. **Make sure Python is installed.** If you don’t have it, what are you even doing with your life?

   - Download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - Run:
     ```sh
     python --version
     ```
     If that fails, congrats! You already messed up the easiest step.

3. **Install dependencies.** Because even a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game somehow needs a `requirements.txt` file.

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the game.** Because your time clearly has no value.
   ```sh
   python runner.py
   ```

## 🚷 How to Play (If You Really Want To)

1. Choose "Play as X" or "Play As O" and the game starts.
1. Enter your move by clicking on the grid you want.
1. Watch as the AI coldly calculates your inevitable defeat.
1. Repeat until you question all of your life choices.

## 🤦‍♂️ Contribution Guidelines

- Think you can improve this **groundbreaking** game? Fork it, I guess.
- Found a bug? Open an issue, but let’s be honest—you’ll probably just rage-quit instead.
- Have a new feature idea? Don't. It's Tic-Tac-Toe. There’s **literally nothing left to add**.

## 💀 Final Thoughts

At the end of the day, you’re playing a game that no one actually **enjoys**, against an AI that doesn’t care about your existence, on a console that reminds you how far we’ve fallen as a species. Have fun! 🎉
